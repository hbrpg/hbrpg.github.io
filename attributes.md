# Attributes
The five attributes are the core of every character that define who they are as a person and how they approach the situations in front of them.
These attributes are Grit, Wit, Logic, Zeal, and Sense. They influence how good a character is at trying to solve the challenges facing them.

## Grit
Grit is your stubbornness and your ability to persist in the face of obstacles. When struggling to move through quicksand you might use your Grit to push through to the other side safely. Similarly in a social situation it you might use to badger a guard into letting you into a locked room by aggressively refusing to consider any other option.

## Wit
Wit defines a character's mental agility. When you accidentally trigger a trap you might use your Wit in order to avoid the spikes rushing at you. When getting past a guard you might use your Wit in order to trick them into believing you are much more important than you really are.

## Logic
Logic is your natural problem solving and ability to reason. You might use Logic while trying to decipher the effects of a complicated runic circle or when taking apart some arcane machinery. In a social situation you might use it to convince a guard that you could not possibly be the thief they are looking for because you were clearly just hiking through swamp just outside the town.

## Zeal
Zeal defines a character's force of personality and strength of belief. When faced with a locked door a character might use their Zeal to simply bash down the door. While trying to get past a guard you might use your Zeal to convince them that your cause is just and that should not just let you past but perhaps even join you in your search.

## Sense
Sense is your ability to understand others and the world around you. You might use it to track a fleeing thief or spot a hidden trap. In a social situation you might use it tell when a shady guard is lying to you and then convince them to give up the location of a local safehouse.

## Encounters

Every moment of gameplay happens within some type of encounter. These types are **Conflict**, **Narrative**, and **Downtime**.

## Types of Encounters
### Conflict
**Conflict** encounters are the most rules-heavy type of encounter. It is used when turn based actions are needed. Most combats will take place here though you may also want to run some particularly tense social situations as conflict encounters.

See the [conflict encounter](/encounters/conflict.md) page for more details on these.

### Narrative
**Narrative** encounters are the most common types of encounters and this mode is used when each action the players take is important but the order and timing of everything doesn't matter. You would often use a Narrative encounter while exploring a lost temple or casually talking to a guard.

Actions and skill checks can be made at anytime that is appropriate.

### Downtime
The least rules-heavy type of encounter, **Downtime** encounters are used when the GM wishes to skip over a lot of smaller actions.

For example, when trying to setup defenses in a village for an impending attack you might not care about lifting a particular log into place or other small details. Instead you broadly describe what you want to accomplish and the GM may make you roll a skill check if appropriate.

Generally if you would be tempted to use an ability or take a specific action you are in a **Narrative** encounter instead of a **Downtime** encounter.

## Transitioning Between Encounters
Generally you can freely transition between any of the encounters as the story demands. **Conflict** encounters are special in that you will have to determine turn order anytime you enter one. See the [Conflict](/encounters/conflict.md) encounter rules for more details.

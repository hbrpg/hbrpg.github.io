# Abilities
Each character has a number of abilities that they can activate. These may represent everything from spells your character knows to a special sword technique they've mastered. Some basic abilities are available to everyone. Every other ability will be drawn from the [pillars](/pillars.md) your character has.

Most abilities take an action to use (see the [encounter](/encounter.md) rules) and can be activated at any time. Some abilities may specify if there are special conditions that must be met before they can be used or whether you must make a roll as part of activating the ability.

## Duration
Abilities will be marked as **Instant** or **Continuous**. **Instant** abilities happen immediately while **Continuous** abilities will have some sort of ongoing effect.

You may only have one **Continuous** ability at a time. If you use a **Continuous** ability while you already have one the current one immediately ends.

## Rituals

**Ritual** abilities are special abilities that take longer to use. A **Ritual** abilities takes 5 minutes of uninterrupted effort to activate. Similarly to normal abilities, **Ritual** abilities may be **Instant** or **Continuous**.

As an exception to the limit on one **Continuous** ability active, you may have one additional **Ritual Continuous** ability active at a time.

## Daily
Some abilities may be marked as **Daily** abilities. These may only be used once per day.

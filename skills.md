# Skills
Depending on their training, background, and various experiences during the course of the game a character will be especially skilled at various tasks. This takes the form of skills which are used when trying to overcome various challenges set by the GM.

Each skill you have will have a number of ranks in it from 1-5. This is the bonus to your roll that you get when using the skill and represents how good you are at tasks related to this skill.

There is no set list of skills though some things may give you specific skills. The following is an example list of skills though you may always pick something other than these. Consult with your GM to make sure your skills are about the same power as these.

* Nature
* Religion
* Animal Handling
* Insight
* Medicine
* Perception

## Skill Challenges
When trying to overcome an obstacle of any sort the GM will first determine whether or not the challenge is something that is easily done or simply impossible. If it is easy you simply do it and if it is impossible you immediately fail at whatever you were trying to do. In both cases you don't roll.

However, there are many other times where the outcome is less certain. In these cases you must first decide how you are approaching the challenge by selecting one of your Attributes to use. You and the GM then agree on your best skill, if any, that applies to the challenge.

The GM will then set the Difficulty Number for the challenge based on what [Attribute](/attributes.md) you chose. Note some tasks may be harder or easier depending on your approach. Finally you roll a 1d20 and add both your Attribute and your Skill level. If it meets or exceeds the Difficulty Number then you succeed at what your were trying to accomplish. Otherwise you fail. The GM will narrate the results of either scenario.

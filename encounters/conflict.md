# Conflict
Conflict encounters are used anytime there is a scene that needs careful turn based action. This may be intense stealth sequences, combat, or any number of others.

## Structure of a Game Round

### Initiative
The first thing all participants must do when entering a conflict encounter is determine **Initiative** which will determine the order everyone takes turns. This is done with a skill check depending on what they were doing before the encounter. Note down the scores they got and then they will take turns each round going from the highest to the lowest score.

### Turn Order
Each game round every participant will get a chance to take a turn in **Initiative order**. As soon as everyone has had a turn a new round starts until the encounter is over.

### Turn
Each turn a character will get to move up to their movement speed and may take a single action. The movement may split so that some happens before/after any actions.

## Combat
One of the most common reasons to be in a conflict encounter is for combat. This section covers the rules related specifically to combat scenarios.

### Attacking
Every character has the generic attack ability which is an [Instant Ability](../abilities.md) with the following description.

To make an attack first check if your weapon is in range of your target. If it isn't the attack fails. Then you must pass a TN 10 check with your weapon's attribute as the bonus in order to see if you hit the target. If you hit the target you deal your weapons damage to the target.

If you are unarmed you may still make an attack but your range is 5ft, you get no attribute bonus to hit, and you only do a single damage on a hit.

### Health
Every character has some amount of health. If for any reason you hit 0 health remaining you die. Any [Continuous Abilities](../abilities.html) you had immediately end.

*Note: This is a temporary rule and will be changed to be less punishing Soonâ„¢*
